# 1054-Midterm
This is a GitHub repo for my (1054) midterm project.

This is a basic website of dogs where one can find informationa bout dog breeds, fun facts and diet plan for all dog breeds.

Here in the Header section I've addeed a logo of the website with clickable link which redirects to the home page.

In the navigation menu I've added 5 sections. Home,Breeds,Care & Traning, Fun Facts and Diet plan. Here in the nav menu I've used added a gray backgroudn with white bold text and a subtle hover effecting using css. Since this is just a home page the Navigation links are kept null (#)

In the body section I've added 3 images in list view and chaned the corners to round and added hyperlink to each of the 3 body images. Thouse hyperlink in future will lead to theri specific profile.


Here I've changed the title of the website and added details in the image and 
Added a new feedback form along.
